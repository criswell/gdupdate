# Godaddy sub-domain updater

This is a simple tool to update a given DNS hosts file managed by Godaddy.
You can (sort of) think of this as a way to get Dynamic DNS from a domain name
managed by Godaddy. This script can be run manually, from crom, or any other
way a script gets executed on your system.

## Requirements

* [Python 2.x](https://www.python.org/)
* [godaddypy](https://github.com/eXamadeus/godaddypy)
* [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
* argparse
* wsgiref

Once Python is installed, the dependencies can be installed via pip:

```
# For system-wide install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For local-user install
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
usage: update.py [-h] config

positional arguments:
  config      The JSON config file to load.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

### Configuration file

`update.py` requires a valid configuration JSON file. There is a sample config
file included in this repository which you can use as a template (be sure to
remove the comments, those aren't valid JSON).

The configuration file needs to have the following fields:

* `domain` : This field indicates the base domain you wish to update. Let's say
I wanted `ssh.foobar.net` to be the full name for my IP to point to. In that
case, `domain` would be `foobar.net`.
* `sub-domain` : This field indicates the sub-domain you wish to update. Again,
if I wanted `ssh.foobar.net` to be the full name for my IP to point to, I'd
have `sub-domain` be `ssh`.
* `refresh_time` : update.py keeps track of the last time it updated the IP
and what the last IP was. `refresh_time` is a field that tells the script to
update the IP after this duration regardless if the IP has changed or not. The
field should be another JSON dictionary indicating `hours`, `days`, `seconds`,
and `weeks`.
* `ip_url` : This is a website which, when accessed, will return the IP
information for the caller. See below for more information.
* `key` : This is the application key from Godaddy's API key tool.
* `secret_key` : This is the secret key from Godaddy's API key tool.

#### Setting the IP from a URL

The `ip_url` setting in the configuration file detailed above must return a
JSON object containing a field, `ip` which has the IP address to be used. The
idea here is that the remote site will be able to return the public address of
the system contacting it (which, in turn, can be used to find out the correct
IP for the dynamic DNS to work). Of course, it can return *any* IP address
and the updater will use it. So, if you wanted, you could use this for
something other than dynamic DNS.

### Configuration file after run

After the updater script runs, it will update the config JSON file with two
new entries:

* `last_ip` : This is the last IP used to update Godaddy.
* `last_update` : This is the last time Godaddy was updated.

These two entries will always be automatically generated by the script, and are
not intended to be manually changed.
